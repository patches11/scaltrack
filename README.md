#Scala Skeleton Tracking

Originally used in my E11 art project Synthesis with depth data from a Kinect.

###based on:

[Real-time Identification and Localization
    of Body Parts from Depth Images](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.187.4455&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

and

[Skeltrack](https://github.com/joaquimrocha/Skeltrack)

###Not yet done:

I have only implemented the first step indicated in the paper, interest point classification. After that there is a second step of classifying these interest points via a model trained on motion capture data. One option may be to see how Skeltrack is handing this, as I don't believe they are using a model.
